## Description
Simule is a composition for Saxaphone and Computer by Anthony Pe√±a

This work is inspired by the musical work ['Electric Counterpoint'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7XlZKFH7h8) by Steve Reich. 

Originally, Electric Counterpoint is to be performed by a guitarist following a pre-recorded tape of various other guitar lines.

Simule, aims to replicate a similar affect with a Saxaphone and Computer by doing real time processing of the Saxaphone's audio within [Cycling 74's Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max).

Max is a visual coding language.
